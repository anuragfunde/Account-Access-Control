# Account-Access-Control

There are some ott platforms that get the user logged in using phone number and otp. So if user want to share their account with their friends they simply share their registered contact number and otp.So here our system comes to prevent this problem. That person cant use others account.
This system will send otp embedded in an image using steganography to prevent the otp sharing to restrict others by using the account of one who owns it.
